Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms,
whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite,
vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months.
Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure.
Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer.
